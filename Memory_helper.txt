Unnormalize NN values when adding up to the node depth. 

Side by side comparisons. Original, prediction, error.

Multiple rainfall events.

Runoff instead of rainfall

Performance metrics. Calculate the error of the time series as Elvin in Bishwadeep's presentation.
Statistics:    Number of parameters. Number of training examples.

Consider the invert offsets.

Consider two different networks depending on the pipe section.
(One for the EGG and other for the CIRCLE)

Check Saint-Vennant equations.

Heun or Runge-Kutta approach.

Metrics of performance.

Hyperoptimization of the Neural Network

The time for running the simulations in SWMM (1 block rainfall, 10 synthetic cases, 10 real cases with intensity bigger than 10) was 5 minutes, 19 seconds

I removed the DWF information from the inp file.

There are two ways that the information can be used. One is for training the program (generating the sample objects)
The other is by passing an event (runoff) and an initial depth to see how it solves it.

I improved the database code: Moved the extract heads and runoff method to the utils part.

Remember to include the nodal area (also for the future storage tanks)

Debe simular la profundidad en todos los nodos. Especialmente en los outfalls. Cómo sé cuánto caudal pasa?
La condición de frontera es cero, así que debe ser función del valor que se está rechazando, el que se está volviendo cero.

Hay un problema con las diferencias de nivel, su magnitud es mayor a uno, no es bueno para entrenar las redes neuronales.

Pass the diameter multiple times to the ANN that calculates dh due to gradient.

Include the manhole area as node attribute.
