Unnormalize NN values when adding up to the node depth. 

Side by side comparisons. Original, prediction, error.

Multiple rainfall events.

Runoff instead of rainfall

Performance metrics. Calculate the error of the time series as Elvin in Bishwadeep's presentation.
Statistics:    Number of parameters. Number of training examples.

Check Saint-Vennant equations.

Consider the invert offsets.

Consider two different networks depending on the pipe section.
(One for the EGG and other for the CIRCLE)

Heun or Runge-Kutta approach.

Metrics of performance.

The time for running the simulations in SWMM (1 block rainfall, 10 synthetic cases, 10 real cases with intensity bigger than 10) was 5 minutes, 19 seconds

I removed the DWF information from the inp file.
